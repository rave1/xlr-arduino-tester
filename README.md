# xlr-arduino-tester
My program for testing audio cables using arduino


This software sends HIGH state trough every wire in a XLR cable, jack mono and stero can be adapted too, spikon should also work since rareley pins beside 1+ and 1- are used.
If you have any questions contact me trough my mail. And feel free to contribute!
